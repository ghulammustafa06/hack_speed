                <h2>How to Improve Your Typing Speed</h2>
                <p>Take a deep breath, relax your fingers, and take it slow. You need to be focused and not annoyed when
                    attempting the typing speed test. The best thing you can do to start typing faster is to type more.
                    The more practice you get under your belt, the faster your ‘typing-fu’ will be. It’s all about
                    developing muscle memory. Just make sure you are reinforcing good habits and not ones that will
                    leave your fingers hurting after an intense typing session.</p>

                <h2>What Is the Best 10-Finger Typing Layout?</h2>
                <p>Of course, you should use ten fingers for typing, but you can start with a layout that’s the most
                    comfortable for you. The small bumps on the F and J keys will help your fingers locate the correct
                    position without looking. This setup should give you a full range of motion. The more you type, the
                    faster you will get. There are a few alternative layouts that propose a more ergonomic approach to
                    typing. You could also take the big leap and try out the Dvorak keyboard, but that’s a different
                    story.</p>

                <h2>Who Invented the Qwerty Keyboard?</h2>
                <p>The QWERTY keyboard was invented in 1868 by Christopher Latham Sholes. He also designed the first
                    successful typewriter. The order of the keys was decided by listing the most common letter
                    combinations and making sure that they were not placed next to each other. He did this to avoid
                    problems that often happened when two neighboring keys were pressed consecutively. The QWERTY
                    keyboard is used to this day and is the most widely used keyboard available.</p>

                <h2>Word per Minute (WPM) Typing Test</h2>
                <p>What is the WPM typing test? There are different types of tests for typing. This one is a typing test
                    that expresses your typing skills in words per minute. The more you practice typing, and the more
                    you test your typing speed, the higher your WPM score will be. Some online typing tests and typing
                    test games focus only on WPM typing. The disadvantage of the WPM typing test is that you are only
                    learning how to type fast. WPM typing tests do not show your accuracy.</p>

                <h2>Why Is Typing Speed Important to Everyone?</h2>
                <p>The faster you type, the faster you will be able to communicate with others. You will be able to save
                    a ton of time on any kind of work that requires typing. At first, it will be a couple of extra
                    minutes that you won’t really notice. Over time, the minutes will turn into hours of saved time that
                    you can spend on other activities.</p>

            <div class="card">
                <h2>What Is the Average Typing Speed?</h2>
                <p>The average person types between 38 and 40 words per minute (WPM). That translates into between 190
                    and 200 characters per minute (CPM). However, professional typists type a lot faster, averaging
                    between 65 and 75 WPM.</p>

                <h2>How Many Words per Minute Is a Good Score?</h2>
                <p>An average professional typist usually types around 65 to 75 WPM. More advanced positions require 80
                    to 95 (this is typically the minimum required for dispatch positions and other time-sensitive typing
                    jobs). There are also some advanced typists whose work requires speeds above 120 WPM.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h2>What Is CPM and How Can You Calculate It?</h2>
                <p>The CPM stands for the number of characters you type per minute, including all the mistakes.
                    “Corrected” scores count only correctly typed words. WPM is just the corrected CPM divided by five.
                    This is the de facto international standard.</p>
